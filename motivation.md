# Motivation & Funding

We've seen many frameworks rise and fall. The only thing that seems to be constant, is change. While projects like React, Angular and Vue became large code bases, non-framework approaches like Svelte and Stencil are promoting methods of inlining functionality to get around the need to deploy a framework.

There are many, those frameworks have in common, but lets pick out some major vectors:

1. **Complexity**: Expect a steep learning curve to be productive
2. **Abstraction**: With VDOM's you can't safely work with real DOM API's at runtime 
3. **Vendor lock-in**: Due to their non-standard API's, code isn't inter-operable
4. **Size:** Even if we take Svelte or Stencil: Inlining leads to code duplication and we don't gain much in size with many components being deployed in larger projects.

With SpringType, we're breaking these limitations, while providing a state-of-the-art API. SpringType is a micro-framework that allows component-driven development and safe, native DOM API access at the same time. The size of the transpiled and optimized framework is at records low and there is still potential as we're in beta phase right now.

SpringType is an attempt to give you back the power: _You decide what happens and when_.
