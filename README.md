# Welcome to SpringType!

SpringType is a zero-dependency micro-framework for Website and PWA development. It's pure **TypeScript** and promotes modern APIs. SpringTypes unique approach allows for **less complexity**, **tiny footprint**, **high performance** and a **stellar** **developer experience** ðŸš€

**How stellar?** You gain maximum **flexibility**, **compatibility**, and **high security** with a **zero-dependency** **micro-framework**, whose empty project production builds are **&lt; 20KiB in size.**

### Our Vision is...

> A beautiful new take on modern web development that brings back the fun and simplicity in web development - while pushing modern standards further.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that SpringType is still in **beta phase.** We're looking forward to release the **first stable 1.0.0 GA in Spring 2020** [ðŸŒ±](https://emojipedia.org/seedling/)ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž. As of now, most API's are stable, but we are adding some minor features and fixing bugs.

[Please help us becoming better and report use-cases, suggestions and bugs.](https://github.com/springtype-org/springtype/issues)

### Try it

We recommend, to [take approx. 60 minutes to run through our introduction](introduction/). In fact, you'll already learn ~80% of what you'll ever need to know in this short amount of time.

But if you're an experienced developer or in a hurry, just run this CLI command:

```bash
> npx st-create -c project -t guide -d SpringTypeSandBox
```

[**`Node.js`**](https://nodejs.org) and [**`yarn`**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) are prerequisites. Please install them first.

{% hint style="info" %}
_SpringType_ is named like that, because every _Spring_ marks a new beginning, a beautiful new chance to welcome a new era, an era of _Typed_ web development.
