# Welcome to SpringType!

SpringType is a zero-dependency micro-framework for Website and PWA development. It promotes the use of TypeScript and modern browser APIs. SpringType's unique approach allows for **less complexity**, **fewer code**, **better performance** and a stellar **developer experience** [ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

### Pitch in one Sentence

> A beautiful new take on modern web development that brings back the fun and simplicity in web development - while pushing modern standards further.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that SpringType is still in **beta phase.** We're looking forward to release the **first stable 1.0.0 GA in Spring 2020** [ðŸŒ±](https://emojipedia.org/seedling/)ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž. As of now, bugs may happen more often, API's may change at will and CLIs may break on platforms at times.

But if you're an experienced developer or in a hurry, just run this CLI command:

```bash
> npx st-create -c project -t guide -n SpringTypeSandBox
```
