# Getting Started

## What is SpringType? ****[ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

SpringType is a full-stack web framework for Website, PWA and App development. It promotes the use of TypeScript and modern browser and Node.js APIs. Novel algorithms allow for **less complexity**, **fewer code**, **higher performance** and a stellar **developer experience**.

While designing SpringType, we've re-invented almost every wheel. **SpringType is Typed**, so you get **auto-completable API**'s and **compile-time type safety without any runtime overhead**. It uses **Virtual  Components** that are rendered as a **clean DOM**, emit **Custom DOM Events** and allow for **Custom DOM Attributes**. It is all DOM standards based, so there is **no magic abstraction**.

Our **Virtual DOM** is HTML and SVG-compatible \(no nasty attribute names\), allows for **non-VDOM subtrees** \(your old JS code is compatible\) and implements `<slot>` , `<fragment>` && `<template>` **without the need for web components**. 

Oh, and it **re-hydrates the existing DOM**, so you can also use all your components **with HTML only** and **server-side rendering \(SSR\)** is no issue at all. 

But can it handle **Style Encapsulation**? Yes, using auto-prefixing CSS selectors and strong conventions. And it supports **PostCSS out-of-the-box** at compile time, so there is **no runtime overhead as well.**

Nice, but can we have support for **DI**, **Change Detection \(by reference and deep\)** and a **Context API** too? Sure, it is reactive as well. And on top of that you get an **i18n API,** a **DOM Router**, **scoped** **globalThis** and a great **Logging API** for free.

My oh my, this sounds like another fatty JS framework? Not at all! **Typical app builds are &lt; 10 KiB gzipped** and **render in &lt; 0.1ms** \(even with the worst Google Lighthouse settings\)**.**

**Uh, and**  `st-start` transpiles TypeScript and JavaScript into **optimized production builds** with **true zero configuration**. It comes with a clever dynamic webpack configuration and seamlessly reloads codes changes in development mode \(**HMR**\).
