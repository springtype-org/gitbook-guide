# 3rd-party Library Support

We're proud to present a few libraries that we've written compatibility API's for. As previously stated, SpringType supports every JavaScript and CSS framework out there by design. 

However, for convenience, it's sometimes a better approach to write some helper functions for setup and integration, or even provide some wrapper components, following composition over inheritance.
