# Common Errors

## Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:4444

There is another port of `st-start` running on your system. Because of that, the port `4444` is already in use. You can either stop the other process or create a file `st.config.ts` with the following code:

{% code title="st.config.ts" %}
```typescript
import { setConfig } from "st-start";

setConfig({
    port: 4445 /* or any other free port you desire */
});
```
{% endcode %}
