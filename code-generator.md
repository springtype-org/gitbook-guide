# Scaffolding

[**`st-create`**](https://github.com/springtype-org/st-create) is a versatile, template based code generator:

* [x] It supports **project templates** \(PWA, website, game, etc.\) 
* [x] It also supports your **own custom templates**
* [x] You can also **generate new `<Components />`**  and **`Services`** for your app
  * [x] With templates for **standard UI's like: Login form** etc.
  * [x] In all flavors, like **Ionic 4**, **Google** **Material Design** and even **Bootstrap 4**

Did we mention that _SpringType_ comes with cool third-party framework integrations?

* [x] SpringType guide for playing around _\(WIP\)_
* [x] Ionic 4 \(official\) for PWA's
* [x] Materialize.css for Websites and PWA's _\(WIP\)_
* [x] Babylon 3D for Games
* [x] OpenLayers for interactive Map Applications

This gives you a **jump-start that has never been seen before**. Have fun!
